# Le Red Bread

### Summary

Le Red Bread is a multi-page custom WordPress theme. It is designed to allow the owner of the bakery to write and submit blog posts, change business hours on the fly the LRB Biz Hours Widget and add or remove bakery products.

### Tools and methods

The making of Le Red Bread focused largely on the use of PHP, HTML and CSS. However other tools and methods used included:

* Plugins - Theme Check, Debug Bar, Contact Form 7, Custom Field Suite, Le Red Bread Functionality, LRB Biz Hours Widget
* WordPress
* Flexbox layout
* Gulp, SASS, Autoprefixer, Browser-Sync,
* Git and GitHub

### Experience

Building a theme from scratch was a tough yet exciting experience. The most challenging part was truly understanding how the template hierarchy works. Once you master that, everything else will fall into place. I found that I should have taken the time to explore the PHP pages and to use SASS variables and mixins early on. Besides that I can't wait to start on the next one!
